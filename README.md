# OD_work
My own work files for the OD simulation development of Chroma (https://github.com/nEXO-collaboration/chroma-simulation) during summer 2021.

## General Files
#### Plotting.ipynb

#### hfiles.ipynb

#### LittleFunction.py / .ipynb

#### PlotPhotonPaths.py

#### yamlFileWrite.ipynb
Playing around with writing to h5 files.

## Optics

## CherenkovGen
#### CherenkovLight.ipynb
Work done to take Soud's code (https://github.com/soudk/phys512/blob/master/project_cherenkov/NumbaCherenkov.ipynb) to develop the code to go in to Chroma to generate Cherenkov light from a muon.   
CherenkovSource.py was used to format some of this code into a format to actually be copied into Chroma
 
#### CherenkovTheory.ipynb
Details on the Cherenkov light wavelengths; number of photons; and looking at the PMT's QE to look at what range of wavelengths we need to simulate.

#### MuonResults.ipynb
Plots generated muons' entry and exit positions of the water tank.
## 
### Paths
Contains text file output of the step by step output of each photon for small runs done early in the summer.

### h5_files
Resulting .h5 files from OD Chroma runs during various stages of the development.
